<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Let us now go back to our motivating campfire example. There we had</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
f(x) \amp= \text{ temperature at position $x$}\\
x(t) \amp= \text{ position at time $t$}\\
F(t) \amp= f(x(t)) = \text{ temperature at time $t$}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The chain rule gave</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
F'(t) \amp= f'\big(x(t)\big) \cdot x'(t)
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Notice that the units of measurement on both sides of the equation agree â€” as indeed they must. To see this, let us assume that <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is measured in seconds, that <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> is measured in metres and that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is measured in degrees. Because of this <span class="process-math">\(F(x(t))\)</span> must also be measured in degrees (since it is a temperature).</p>
<p>What about the derivatives? These are rates of change. So</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(F'(t)\)</span> has units <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\rm degrees}{\rm second}\text{,}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> has units <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\rm degrees}{\rm metre}\text{,}\)</span> and</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(x'(t)\)</span> has units <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\rm metre}{\rm second}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Hence the product</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
f'\big(x(t)\big) \cdot x'(t) \amp
\text{ has units } = \frac{\rm degrees}{\rm metre} \cdot
\frac{\rm metre}{\rm second}
= \frac{\rm degrees}{\rm second}.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">has the same units as <span class="process-math">\(F'(t)\text{.}\)</span> So the units on both sides of the equation agree. Checking that the units on both sides of an equation agree is a good check of consistency, but of course it does not prove that both sides are in fact the same.</p></article></body>
