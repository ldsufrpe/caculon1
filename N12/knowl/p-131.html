<li><p>It is often (but not always) the case that, when <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has a local maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x=c\text{,}\)</span> the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> increases strictly as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> from the left and decreases strictly as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> leaves <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> to the right. That is, <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) \gt 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> just to the left of <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) \lt 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> just to the right of <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> Then, it is often the case, because <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is decreasing as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases through <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> that <span class="process-math">\(f''(c) \lt 0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Conversely, if <span class="process-math">\(f'(c)=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''(c) \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> then, just to the right of <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> must be negative, so that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is decreasing, and  just to the left of <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> must be positive, so that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is increasing. So <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has a local maximum at <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, it is often the case that, when <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has a local minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x=c\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) \lt 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> just to the left of <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) \gt 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> just to the right of <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''(x) \gt 0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Conversely, if <span class="process-math">\(f'(c)=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''(c) \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> then, just to the right of <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> must be positive, so that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is increasing, and, just to the left of <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> must be negative, so that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is decreasing. So <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has a local minimum at <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
