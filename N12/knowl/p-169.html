<li><p>Read — read the problem carefully. Work out what information is given in the statement of the problem and what we are being asked to compute.</p></li>
<li><p>Diagram — draw a diagram. This will typically help you to identify what you know about the problem and what quantities you need to work out.</p></li>
<li><p>Variables — assign variables to the quantities in the problem along with their units. It is typically a good idea to make sensible choices of variable names: <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> for area, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> for height, <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> for time etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Relations — find relations between the variables. By now you should know the quantity we are interested in (the one we want to maximise or minimise) and we need to establish a relation between it and the other variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce — the relation down to a function of one variable. In order to apply the calculus we know, we must have a function of a single variable. To do this we need to use all the information we have to eliminate variables. We should also work out the domain of the resulting function.</p></li>
<li><p>Maximise or minimise — we can now apply the methods of Corollary <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cor_find_maxmin.html" title="Corolário 2.13">Corolário 2.13</a> to find the maximum or minimum of the quantity we need (as the problem dictates).</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful — make sure your answer makes sense. Make sure quantities are physical. For example, lengths and areas cannot be negative.</p></li>
<li><p>Answer the question — be sure your answer really answers the question asked in the problem.</p></li>
