<p>So to write up our answer we can put something like the following —  keeping in mind we need to tell the reader what we are doing so they can follow along easily.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>We will use the IVT to prove that there is a zero in <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>First we must show that the function is continuous.</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li><p>Since <span class="process-math">\(x-1\)</span> is a polynomial it is continuous everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>The function <span class="process-math">\(\sin(\pi x/2)\)</span> is a trigonometric function and is also  continuous everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>The sum of two continuous functions is also continuous, so <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is  continuous everywhere.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Let <span class="process-math">\(a=0, b=1\text{,}\)</span> then<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
f(0) \amp= 0 - 1 + \sin(0) = -1  \lt  0\\
f(1) \amp= 1-1+\sin(\pi/2) = 1  \gt  0
\end{align*}
</div></p></li>
<li><p>The function is negative at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and positive at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span> Since the  function is continuous we know there is a point <span class="process-math">\(c \in [0,1]\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(f(c) =  0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Notice that though we have not used full sentences in our explanation here, we  are still using words. Your mathematics, unless it is very straight-forward  computation, should contain words as well as symbols.</p>
