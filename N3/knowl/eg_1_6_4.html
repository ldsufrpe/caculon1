<p>You are climbing the Grouse-grind <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Nota de rodapé 1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> with a friend — call him Bob. Bob was eager and started at 9am. Bob,  while very eager, is also very clumsy; he sprained his ankle somewhere  along the path and has stopped moving at 9:21am and is just sitting <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Nota de rodapé 1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> enjoying the  view. You get there late and start climbing at 10am and being quite fit you get to the  top at 11am. The IVT implies that at some time between 10am and 11am you  meet up with Bob.</p>
<p>You can translate this situation into the form of the IVT as follows. Let <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>  be time and let <span class="process-math">\(a = \)</span> 10am and <span class="process-math">\(b=\)</span> 11am. Let <span class="process-math">\(g(t)\)</span> be your distance along the trail. Hence <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Nota de rodapé 1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> <span class="process-math">\(g(a) = 0\)</span> and  <span class="process-math">\(g(b) = 2.9km\text{.}\)</span> Since you are a mortal, your position along the trail is a  continuous function — no helicopters or teleportation or… We have no idea  where Bob is sitting, except that he is somewhere between <span class="process-math">\(g(a)\)</span> and  <span class="process-math">\(g(b)\text{,}\)</span> call this point <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span> The IVT guarantees that there is some time <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>  between <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> (so between 10am and 11am) with <span class="process-math">\(g(c) = Y\)</span> (and your  position will be the same as Bob's).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-1.html#eg_1_6_4" class="internal">em contexto</a></span>
