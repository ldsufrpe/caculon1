<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Show that the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x-1+\sin(\pi x/2)\)</span> has a zero  in <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq x \leq 1\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>This question has been set up nicely to lead us towards using the IVT;  we are  already given a nice interval on which to look. In general we might have to  test a few points and experiment a bit with a calculator before we can  start narrowing down a range.</p>
<p>Let us start by testing the endpoints of the interval we are given</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
f(0) \amp= 0 - 1 + \sin(0) = -1  \lt  0\\
f(1) \amp= 1-1+\sin(\pi/2) = 1  \gt  0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">So we know a point where <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is positive and one where it is negative. So by  the IVT there is a point in between where it is zero.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">BUT</em> in order to apply the IVT we have to show that the function is  continuous, and we cannot simply write</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>it is continuous</p></blockquote>
<p>We need to explain to the reader <em class="emphasis">why</em> it is continuous. That is — we  have to prove it.</p>
<p>So to write up our answer we can put something like the following —  keeping in mind we need to tell the reader what we are doing so they can follow along easily.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>We will use the IVT to prove that there is a zero in <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>First we must show that the function is continuous.</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li><p>Since <span class="process-math">\(x-1\)</span> is a polynomial it is continuous everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>The function <span class="process-math">\(\sin(\pi x/2)\)</span> is a trigonometric function and is also  continuous everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>The sum of two continuous functions is also continuous, so <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is  continuous everywhere.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Let <span class="process-math">\(a=0, b=1\text{,}\)</span> then<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
f(0) \amp= 0 - 1 + \sin(0) = -1  \lt  0\\
f(1) \amp= 1-1+\sin(\pi/2) = 1  \gt  0
\end{align*}
</div></p></li>
<li><p>The function is negative at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and positive at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span> Since the  function is continuous we know there is a point <span class="process-math">\(c \in [0,1]\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(f(c) =  0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Notice that though we have not used full sentences in our explanation here, we  are still using words. Your mathematics, unless it is very straight-forward  computation, should contain words as well as symbols.</p>
<p>The zero of this function is actually located at about <span class="process-math">\(x=0.4053883559\text{.}\)</span></p></article></body>
